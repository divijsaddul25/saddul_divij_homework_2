        <h3>Story of Simon Riley</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Lieutenant Simon "Ghost" Riley is one of the protagonist in Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2.
            He is a British special forces operator.
             <br>
            He is seen wearing dark red sunglasses and a skull patterned balaclava along with headphones with a mic.
            <br>
            Ghost was born in Manchester and he had a terrible childhood because he had abusive parents
            and his brother would scare him with a mask at night. 
            <br>
            When he grew up, he joined the British millitary and returned back home in 2003 when he saw his whole family ruined.
            <br>
            He decided to stay and fix everyone of them. He helped his brother to quit drug and he kicked his father out of the house.
            <br>
            When he re joined the special forces later on, he was betrayed by Shepherd and was killed.
